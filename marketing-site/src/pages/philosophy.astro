            What is Ubuntu?
          </h2>

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
            Ubuntu is an ancient African philosophy that recognizes the fundamental interconnectedness of all people. The word comes from the Nguni languages of Southern Africa, and it captures a complex web of concepts: humanity, compassion, community, and the understanding that a person is a person through other people.
          </p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
            Archbishop Desmond Tutu explained it beautifully: "Ubuntu speaks particularly about the fact that you can't exist as a human being in isolation. It speaks about our interconnectedness. We think of ourselves far too frequently as just individuals, separated from one another, whereas you are connected and what you do affects the whole world."
          </p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
            At Nyuchi, Ubuntu is not merely a philosophy we admire from a distance—it is the operating system of our organization. Every product we build, every decision we make, every interaction we have is guided by the question: "Does this strengthen community? Does this honor our interconnectedness?"

          Some might ask: What does an ancient philosophy have to do with modern technology? Everything.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
          Technology has often been designed to isolate—to create filter bubbles, to maximize individual engagement at the expense of community connection, to extract data rather than empower users. Ubuntu offers an alternative vision.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
          Technology built on Ubuntu principles strengthens bonds rather than weakening them. It preserves knowledge rather than fragmenting it. It empowers communities rather than exploiting them. It recognizes that we are all connected, and that what we build affects everyone.
